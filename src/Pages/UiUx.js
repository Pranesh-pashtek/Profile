                        <p>
                        UX stands for user experience, while UI is short for User Interface. Both these aspects are intertwined to produce the desired results.
                          {/* <strong>1.</strong>  */}
                          UI/UX Design is the process of designing the interface, optimizing navigation, and showing relevant features of a product or service. It combines aspects of design with user experience to create interfaces that are easy to use, provide what the users need quickly, look great, are intuitive, and produce an overall positive experience for the user.
                          {/* <strong>2.</strong> */}
                           It also caters to user preferences, perceptivity and the emotional quotient. A good UX design increases usability, accessibility, functionality and enables a pleasurable user interaction with your website or app.

                        <p>
                        Though both UX and UI are often used in the same context, it definitely means two different things. However, one cannot thrive without the other. So what is the difference between the two?

                        <p>UX is the experience a user has with a product or service or during the journey of landing in a website to the end action taken by the user.

                         UI is more design oriented and inclines towards the look and feel of the product. The aim is to create an intuitive platform with interactive elements like icons, buttons, typography, color scheme, imagery, etc…</p>
